# AI-Enhanced Incident Response Automation on Azure

This project introduces a ChatGPT solution on Azure, crafted to elevate cybersecurity incident management. Dive into the Logic App Designer configuration, role assignments, playbook execution, and the generation of context-aware comments by ChatGPT during incident responses. The seamless integration of AI into the SIEM system ensures efficient cybersecurity operations and contributes to enhanced incident resolution through automatically generated comments.

Prerequisites

Before you begin with this project, ensure that you have the following in place:

1. **Azure Account:**
   - Create or use an existing Azure Cloud account.

3. **Azure ChatGPT API Key:**
   - Obtain an API key for ChatGPT from the OpenAI platform. This is necessary for integrating ChatGPT into the incident response workflow.

5. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) System:**
